# TwitchEmotes_SlightlyUnstable

Requires the Twitch Emotes v2 addon to work, get it here. 

Adds support for some of the favourite emotes of <Slightly Unstable> - Blackhand EU to the Twitch Emotes v2 AddOn. 

 

 

Shows Slightly Unstable Discord emotes in your chat by typing them as you would into Twitch. This addon does not access any API and thus emotes have to be added manually. 

If you'd like to request more emotes, please suggest them in the comments and if they're good I'll consider adding them!

 

Available Emotes:

babe_1, babe_2, babe_3, babe_4, jens, heinrich, eric, 187, einhorn, lucas
